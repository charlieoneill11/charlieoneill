# Articles
Here are the articles I plan to write. Every article has a project associated with it to demonstrate the application of the idea.

## Foundations
- NN from scratch (incl. learner) to Pytorch process to fastai process. _PROJECT_: extreme generalisability of logic gates
- Decorators in Python. _PROJECT_: TBD
- Fastai callbacks. _PROJECT_: TBD
- TabNet for tabular data. _PROJECT_: Implementing TabNet from scratch. 

__FINAL BUILD__: write Resnet18 from scratch, using the fastai methodology (see Chapter 19).

## Sequential data, time-series and natural language
- LSTMs for univariate time-series âœ… _PROJECT_: learn trigonometric curves ðŸš€
- LSTMs for multivariate, multi-output time series âœ… _PROJECT_: predict Bitcoin price in next two months ðŸš€
- Transforms and attention for sequential data. _PROJECT_: Either ULMFit or music generation

__FINAL BUILD__: algorithmic trading bot - using deep learning for Optiver stock volatility prediction.

## Natural language proessing
- Language model from scratch using AWD-LSTM âœ… _PROJECT_: sentence generation using new fastai dataset ðŸš€
- Introduction to transformers with Hugging Face âœ… 
- Text classification with DistilBERT âœ… _PROJECT_: offensive tweet classification with _TweetEval_ dataset ðŸš€
- Extractive question-answering with Hugging Face. _PROJECT_: Macuject natural language vision data extraction.


## Image data ðŸŒŒ
- Pytorch training loops: convolutions and convnets âœ… _PROJECT_: Kuzushiji-MNIST ðŸš€
- Using the fastai training system: data collection and uploading, transfer learning. _PROJECT_: classifying satellite image data based on continent
- Improving convolutional nets: residual connections and Resnet. _PROJECT_: FashionMNIST and CAM interpretation.
- Fastai U-nets. _PROJECT_: Segmentation of tumours in lungs
- Transformers for vision. _PROJECT_: compare performance with state-of-the-art CNNs
- Object detection and YOLO5. _PROJECT_: recognising poker cards on a table
- ConvNext. _PROJECT_: compare performance with state-of-the-art vision transformers.

__FINAL BUILD__: end-to-end computer vision system for poker prediction.

## Reinforcement learning ðŸ•¹
- TBD

__FINAL BUILD__: AlphaZero Lite for checkers playing.

## Graph/geometric ML ðŸ§¬
- TBD

__FINAL BUILD__: using graph neural networks to construct causal models.

## Generative adversarial networks
- Neural style transfer
- DeepDream

__FINAL BUILD__: sequential image generation for images over time - OCT scans.

## Computational neuroscience ðŸ§ 
- TBD

__FINAL BUILD__: recreate prefrontal cortex and neuron activation dual-reinforcement meta-learning system.

## MLOps ðŸš¦
- Pipeline creation with Amazon Sagemaker and scikit-learn
- Weights and biases logging. _PROJECT_: MNIST.
- Nbdev for Jupyter notebooks Python package development. _PROJECT_: Pyject.
- Why you need to learn to love conda environments.
